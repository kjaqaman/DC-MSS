# DC-MSS
Divide-and-Conquer Moment Scaling Spectrum transient diffusion analysis

DC-MSS is a transient motion analysis software (written in Matlab) that is designed to:

1. Distinguish between free diffusion, confined diffusion, immobility and diffusion with drift.
2. Segment tracks into subparts exhibiting the different motion classes.
